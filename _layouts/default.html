	 <div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Search and Rescue </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right"> 09/2021-04/2022</div> <br>   
	Built a baseline to run and train the model containing the action selector, replay buffer, actor and critic model. Designed and simulated 
	the environment for searching and rescuing containing the observation, state change and reward function. <br>
	Designed a multi-agent model based on recurrent neural networks for searching the environment and tracking the targets. Encoded
	the observation and experiences of the agents. The project achieved a high success rate in finding all of the targets and efficiency to 
	track the targets. <br>
		     <br>
	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> AAPL Stock Price Forecast </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right"> 09/2021-01/2022</div> <br>  
	Proposed an attention-based LSTM for time series analysis to forecast the stock price in the next month. Extensive data were collected 
	from API, filtered, semantically analysed and stored in the cloud. The forecast is close to the actual data. <br>
		     <br>
	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> MRI Brain Tumor Detection and Classification </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right"> 09/2021-12/2021</div> <br> 
	Implemented both ML and DL classifiers to detect and classify the brain tumour. Designed the CNN and implemented ten models
	from research. Achieved high accuracies in both tumour detection and classification. The project enhanced my knowledge of image 
	processing, feature extraction and selection techniques and my skills to adjust the hypermeters and design the experiments.

	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> Reconstructing and Classifying Obfuscated Image with Neural Network Approach  </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right"> 09/2020-04/2021</div> <br>
	Designed the neural network structure based on the model structures used for image super-resolution, image deblurring and image 
	style transfer. Reconstructed the image processed by different obfuscated techniques and obfuscation levels including Gaussian 
	smoothing and pixelization. The generated images are highly identical to the original images measured by PSNR and SSIM. <br>
	Further reconstructed the face features processed by an obfuscation technique using GAN. The project achieved the classification 
	accuracy of recognising the reconstructed images very close to the original image. <br>
		     <br>
	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> Planning and Controlling of a Cleaning Robot  </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right"> 03/2021-05/2021</div> <br>
	Designed an RL algorithm for the cleaning robot in a continuous environment: designed the high-level planning and low-level control 
	of the robot. The algorithm achieved a high success rate in trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. Gained a comprehensive view 
	of the Markov decision process, DDPG, hindsight experience replay and reward function. <br>
		     <br>
	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> Football Match prediction  </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right">  12/2020-01/2021 </div> <br>
	Implemented ML classifiers to predict the football match results using feature processing and selection methods and the prior 
	distribution of the environmental factors. Generated the team strength and match condition data. The classifiers achieved a high
	accuracy with limited information. Gained an understanding of optimisation computation and kernel methods. <br>
		     <br>
	<div style="float:left; text-align:left"> <b> Digital Power Supply  </b> </div>  
		     <div style="float:right; text-align:right">  11/2019-03/2020 </div> <br> 
		     <ul> Designed a digital power supply for the Antarctic weather station: analysed the environment requirement, 
		     designed and simulated the circuit, producing the precise and stable output. </ul>
